# Java-Paint-App
A Java drawing project which contains advanced GUI structures. An effective program to learn how to create and use MouseListener, ActionListener, JButton, JTextField, FlowLayout and Colors.

Program includes some features for user to make it easy to draw anything. After entering the width and height of the frame, the user will be able to chose pen size and color. Also, there is a clear button which clears everything in the frame. After changing any setting in the program, user needs to chose the pen option from the menu to use it on the frame. 

Also, there is an error message for any invalid entries which can occur while entering the width and height values.

Possible future updates: Adding tolerance or laser features. Adding an eraser option for user to be able to delete the specific parts, not the all drawing. (and also maybe an eraser size option in the menu to change the size of the eraser.)

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
